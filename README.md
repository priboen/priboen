## Hi there 👋


I am a sixth-semester student at the Informatics Engineering Study Program of Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta. My main interests are Mobile Application Development and front-end development, where I excellence in programming languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, PHP, Flutter and Laravel. Being active in academic and non-academic activities has enabled me to work collaboratively with teams and individuals and exercise my creative and critical thinking skills
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I am currently studying at Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Mobile App Development using Flutter Framework
